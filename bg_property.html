<h2>Ram Mandir Design & Model</h2>
<p style="color:black;>
	 <font size="+4">
The main architect of the Ram Mandir is Chandrakant Sompura. He along with his team has constructed a solid design for the temple. 
The design of the temple was originally made by the Sompura family in 1988. With some new changes and updates, a new design was made in 2020. 
The design is ideal as per Vastu Shastra as well as Shipa Shastra.

If we talk about the dimensions of the temple, Ayodhya Ram Mandir will be 161 feet tall and 235 feet wide. It will comprise around 366 columns in total. 
These columns will include 16 idols including Chausath Yoginis, Shiva, Sarasvati, and Dashavataras. The main entry stairs of Ram Mandir temple will be 16 feet wide.

The temple was constructed in the area of 2.7 acres of land in Ayodhya. During the last Kumbh Mela, a dummy model of Ayodhya Ram Mandir was showcased. Moreover, 
Ram Mandir will consist of five mandaps in the middle of Garbhagriha. The temple will also have prayer halls, a museum, a Bhajan hall, and many more. 
The temple will be designed in such a way as to depict the 5000-year-old “Sanatan” culture of Hinduism and India.</p>
